Except, when the directory is read-only, in this case the configuration has a reference to a writable file system (see 'readonly') and that is where the process-file is created.\n Commands that consume the process-file shall also process the contents of the associated file that is found at the 'path'.  While the command is processing the contents of the file, it is periodically updating process-file with the current timesamp in the 'processing' field.\nPeriodically, FILES checks for hung processing. A hung process is when the 'processing' timestamp is more than 10 minutes old. It is assumed that hung processing shall not recover, and the process-file is recreated with a new UUID. If a hung processing should recover and resume processing the file, it will find a different UUID in the process-file, at which point it shall shutdown, stop processing the file, and make no changes to the process-file.\nPeriodically FILES checks for processing that has finished. Finished is when the 'processed' field is not zero. FILES has three choices at the finish:\n1/ When read-only file sytems, the process-file continues to exist until something else removes the actual file; 2/ When archiving, the processed file is moved to the archive, and the process-file is removed; 3/ Otherwise, the processed file and process-file are erased.",
