# Welcome to the BigIsland project.

A very big island is called a continent; an island is a mass of land that is both “entirely surrounded by water” and also “smaller than a continent".

The biggest island in the world is Greenland; Australia is a continent.

This project is not a single project:
1. <a href="magpie.md">Magpie</a> Utility modules;
2. <a href="hallelujah/hallelujah.md">Hallelujah</a> another parallel database;
3. <a href="discovery.md">Discovery</a> an assistant in data analysis and Hallelujah schema generation;
4. <a href="sheet.md">Sheet</a> view and transform data in Hallelujah.

bigIsland started as a training exercise during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020-2022, there was a year hiatus (April 2020 to March 2021) to learn Python. Then in April 2021, started the rewrite of this project from Java to Python.
