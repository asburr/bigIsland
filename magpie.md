# Magpie
When it comes to this intelligent black-and-white bird, most people love to hate them. After pigeons, they are one of the most vilified birds in the UK. Reasons for this include their "cheekiness". They are scavengers and collect objects, with a weakness for shiny things.

Scientists think Magpies can recognize their reflection. An orange sticker on the bird is removed by the Magpie when they first see the sticker in a mirror. But is it again the weakness of shiny things?
